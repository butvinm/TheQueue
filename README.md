# The Queue

TheQueue is a Telegram bot that simplifies the process of creating, sharing, and managing queues. Whether you need to organize a waiting list for an event, schedule an exam order in your study group, or manage any other kind of queue, TheQueue makes it easy. With just a few simple commands, you can create a new queue and invite others with an enrollment link.

What's more, each member of the queue can change their own position and cursor within the queue, making it a collaborative, members-managed system.
